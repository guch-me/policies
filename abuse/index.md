# Use Restrictions

*Last updated: January 24, 2021*

If you have an account with any of our products, you can’t use them for any of the restricted purposes listed below. We will terminate an account without advance notice if there is evidence it is being used for a restricted purpose that has, is, or will cause severe harm. If applicable, we will also report the incident to the appropriate authorities.

For other cases, we’ll take a case-by-case approach to clear things up.

Further, as a business that puts our values and conscience ahead of growth at all costs, we reserve the right to deny service to anyone we ultimately feel uncomfortable doing business with.

## Restricted purposes

* **Child exploitation, sexualization, or abuse**: We don’t tolerate any activities that create, disseminate, or otherwise cause child abuse. Keep away and stop. Just stop. 
* **Doxing**: If you are using our products to share other peoples’ private personal information for the purposes of harassment, we don’t want anything to do with you.
* **Infringing on intellectual property**: You can’t use our products to make or disseminate work that uses the intellectual property of others beyond the bounds of fair use.
* **Malware or spyware**: Code for good, not evil. If you are using our products to make or distribute anything that qualifies as malware or spyware — including remote user surveillance — begone.
* **Phishing or otherwise attempting fraud**: It is not okay to lie about who you are or who you affiliate with to steal from, extort, or otherwise harm others.
* **Spamming**: No one wants unsolicited commercial emails. We don’t tolerate folks (including their bots) using our products for spamming purposes. If your emails don’t pass muster with [CAN-SPAM](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business) or any other anti-spam law, it’s not allowed.
* **Cybersquatting**: We don’t like username extortionists. If you purchase a DVPL product account in someone else’s name and then try to sell that account to them, you are [cybersquatting](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1125). Cybersquatting accounts are subject to immediate cancelation.
* **Violence, or threats thereof**: If an activity qualifies as violent crime in India or where you live, you may not use our products to plan, perpetrate, or threaten that activity.

While our use restrictions are comprehensive, they can’t be exhaustive — it’s possible an offense could defy categorization, present for the first time, or illuminate a moral quandary we hadn’t yet considered. That said, we hope the overarching spirit is clear: guch is not to be harnessed for harm, whether mental, physical, personal or civic.

## How to report abuse

Please alert us at [hello@guch.me](mailto:hello@guch.me).

If you’re not 100% sure if something rises to the level of our use restrictions policy, report it anyway. Please share as much as you are comfortable with about the account, the content or behavior you are reporting, and how you found it. Sending us a URL or screenshots is super helpful. We will not disclose your identity to anyone associated with the reported account.

Someone on our team will respond within seven business days to let you know we’ve begun investigating. We will also let you know the outcome of our investigation (unless you ask us not to, or we are not allowed to under law).

**This policy and process applies to any product created and owned by Denture Ventures Pvt. Ltd. That includes guch and final.*

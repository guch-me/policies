# guch subprocessors

We use third party subprocessors, such as cloud computing providers and customer support software, to run guch (the service). We ensure each subprocessor has the same level of data protection as guch everywhere personal data is processed.

The following is a list of personal data subprocessors we use:

* [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/). Cloud services provider.
* [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.co.in/intl/en_in/security/). Communication and collaboration tools.
* [Google Analytics](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US). Analytics software.
* [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/legal/privacy-overview/). Analytics software.
* [Reach.at](https://reach.at/privacy/). Conversational customer interaction platform
* [WP Engine](https://wpengine.com/legal/privacy/). Website hosting.
